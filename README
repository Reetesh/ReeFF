This is a Dynamic Widget for any feed (shown : my twitter feed ) designed by inspirations from my friendfeed page (http://friendfeed.com/reetesh).

I saw how new updates appear automatically and instantaneously at Friendfeed and tried to learn how it is done. After that, the fact that there is a cloud image that goes BEHIND the data that is being shown and then comes back up after crossing the message body amazed me.

It wasn't using flash or any other such embedded method, it was plain CSS and jQuery. So I tried to implement that too. Along with the floating grass that sticks to the bottom of the screen (using CSS).

This was an exercise in HTML, CSS3, jQuery and PHP for me. Started making immediately after learning how things were done and took me 2.5 hours to complete.
